<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This list functions as a bridge, linking both older and newer generations of Fudan students engaged in research. While Fudan University unquestionably boasts prestige, we must also recognize its shortcomings when compared to those top universities (e.g., Tsinghua) --- Just contemplate the discrepancy in the number of Fudan graduates working in world-class universities compared to those from Tsinghua. Through this list, our aspiration is for forthcoming generations of Fudan students seeking research opportunities to establish meaningful connections with their senior Fudan alumni. We believe that professors who have graduated from Fudan would be inclined to provide assistance and offer internship opportunities upon receiving an email from a current Fudan student with a high GPA.
