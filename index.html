<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This list functions as a bridge, connecting both older and newer generations of Fudan students engaged in research. While Fudan University undoubtedly boasts prestige, we must also acknowledge its shortcomings when compared to top universities. Through this list, our aspiration is to help upcoming generations of Fudan students seeking research opportunities establish meaningful connections with their senior Fudan alumni. We believe that professors who have graduated from Fudan would be inclined to provide assistance and offer internship opportunities upon receiving an email from a current Fudan student with a high GPA.</p>

<p>We have just begun formulating this list and are actively expanding it. The individuals considered here meet two criteria: (i) they completed at least one of their bachelor's, master's, or PhD degrees at Fudan University, and (ii) they are currently professors (either tenured or not-tenured) at universities other than Fudan (Note: Fudan students can contact any Fudan professors on campus, so we have chosen not to include them in this list). <strong>We are seeking a group of volunteers to maintain and update this list.</strong> If you are interested, please get in touch with us via email at <a href="mailto:fgfc23.start@gmail.com">fgfc23.start@gmail.com</a>.</p>



<h1>FGFC List</h1>
<p> Each entry is organized in the following format: Name (University, Category) â€” Research Keywords. Please note that [Category] may not necessarily correspond directly to the individual's department or school name, but rather reflects their research interests. The following list is arranged in alphabetical order.
